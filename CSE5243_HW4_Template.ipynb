    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will perform clustering on three datasets.  Your will choose suitable clustering algorithms, evaluate them on the datasets, and compare their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this assignment are:\n",
    "1.\tUnderstand how to select and evaluate suitable off-the-shelf clustering algorithms based on the characteristics of a dataset and the outcomes you need.\n",
    "2.\tUnderstand how to tune and evaluate a clustering algorithm to achieve good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file **small_Xydf.csv** is a two-dimensional dataset with 200 records.  It contains columns X0, X1, and y.  The y column is the actual cluster number that was produced by the dataset generation algorithm.  Do not use it for the clustering algorithm.  It will be used to evaluate your clustering algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file **large1_Xydf.csv** is a two-dimensional dataset with 3000 records.  It contains columns X0, X1, and y.  The y column is the actual cluster number that was produced by the dataset generation algorithm.  Do not use it for the clustering algorithm.  It will be used to evaluate your clustering algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file **large2_Xydf.csv** is another two-dimensional dataset with 3000 records, and characteristics different from the “large1” dataset.  It contains columns X0, X1, and y.  The y column is the actual cluster number that was produced by the dataset generation algorithm.  Do not use it for the clustering algorithm.  It will be used to evaluate your clustering algorithm below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework makes use of the Clustering Algorithms offered by the SciKitLearn Library.  Study the information at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html.  Follow the guidance in the individual sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you should work as an individual. You may informally discuss ideas with classmates, to get advice on general Python usage, etc., but your work should be your own.  Please make use of Microsoft Teams!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need to turn in:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCode\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tFor this homework, the code is the Jupyter Notebook.  Use the provided Jupyter Notebook template, and fill in the appropriate information.\n",
    "-\tThis homework requires you to use clustering algorithms in the SciKitLearn library.  You also may use common Python libraries for I/O, data manipulation, data visualization, etc. (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib,…).  You may not use library operations that perform, in effect, the entire “core” computations for this homework. (e.g., If you happen to find a single function on the web that does essentially *all* of a major portion of the homework, you may not use it.)  When in doubt, ask the grader or instructor.\n",
    "-\tThe code must be written by you, and any significant code snips you found on the Internet and used to understand how to do your coding for the core functionality must be attributed.  (You do not need to attribute basic functionality – matrix operations, IO, etc.)\n",
    "-\tThe code must be commented sufficiently to allow a reader to understand the algorithm without reading the actual Python, step by step.\n",
    "-\tWhen in doubt, ask the grader or instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWritten Report\n",
    "-\tFor this homework, the report is the Jupyter Notebook.  The report should be well-written.  Please proof-read and remove spelling and grammar errors and typos. Please also include the HTML file, which helps the grading process.\n",
    "-\tThe report should discuss your analysis and observations. Key points and findings must be written in a style suitable for consumption by non-experts.  Present charts and graphs to support your observations. If you performed any data processing, cleaning, etc., please discuss it within the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HTML File\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Grading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tOverall readability and organization of your report (10%) - Is it well organized and does the presentation flow in a logical manner; are there many grammar and spelling mistakes; do the charts/graphs relate to the text, etc.\n",
    "2.\tEvaluation of the K-means Clustering Algorithm on the Small Dataset (15%) – Is your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "3.\tEvaluation of the K-means Clustering Algorithm on the Large1 Dataset (15%) – Is your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "4.\tEvaluation of the K-means Clustering Algorithm on the Large2 Dataset (15%) – Is your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "5.\tEvaluation of the Second Clustering Algorithm on the Large2 Dataset (15%) – Is your choice of algorithm and your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "6.\tEvaluation of the Third Clustering Algorithm on the Large2 Dataset (15%) – Is your choice of algorithm and your configuration sound?  Have you made an effort to tune the algorithm for good performance?  Are your analyses and evaluations sound, and supported by suitable statistics and/or visualizations?\n",
    "7.\tComparison of the Three Clustering Algorithms (10%) - Is the comparison sound?  Did you choose a specific clustering algorithm as best and explain why?\n",
    "8.\tConclusions (5%) – Did you document your overall insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to turn in your work on Carmen:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please follow these instructions exactly** - it helps the grading process.  If you have questions, please ask.  Submit to Carmen any code that you used to process and analyze this data. You do not need to include the input data.  All the related files (code and report) except for the data should be archived in a **zip file (with no folder trees inside)** and submitted via Carmen.  The submitted file should be less than 5MB.  Use this naming convention: **HomeworkN_Surname_DotNumber.zip**\n",

    "   - Summarize the main idea of k-Shape, including the **key challenges** it addresses in time-series clustering (e.g., temporal misalignment, shape similarity).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Apply k-Shape/ k-Means to the CBF dataset:**  \n",
    "   - You may use the k-Shape implementation provided here: **https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/kshape-python?tab=readme-ov-file**.  \n",
    "   - Clearly explain your **experimental settings** and **the reasoning** behind each choice (Ensuring comparisons are fair).\n",

    "3. **Evaluate the clustering results:**  \n",
    "   - Use the provided **External Cluster Evaluation Functions** (e.g., Rand Index: **https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.rand_score.html**) to measure performance.  \n",
